Finding good assets for the objects in the maze were tricky, as not many of them would communicate what I wanted to effectively. For example, I found a "goth pleated skirt" which had a style I did like, but its uniqueness would distract from the idea I wanted to convey, which was simply a renewed interest in skirts. I eventually found a skirt with a plaid pattern that was too dark, so I changed up the material until I was happy with its contrast against the background. I also adjusted the mannequin underneath with probuilder so that it wouldn't clip through the skirt as they were two different assets.

Another tricky one was the makeup. I found a 3 models I could use, but the first one didn't have the materials that were shown on the sketchfab page. The mesh wasn't split either, so I couldn't change the material of the individual items unless I spent a long time selecting faces on probuilder as well as making each material from scratch. The second had some missing faces that couldn't be fixed by simply flipping the normals in probuilder, and the third had floating objects with meshes that weren't separated by each object but rather its materials. I settled on the third one and separated the objects using probuilder. I then downloaded a jewelry box asset and positioned everything in the box. 

I also tinkered with the mary jane heels - The model I downloaded was mostly black. I thought it didn't stand out enough from the black walls of the maze, so I changed the material to a bright red colour that I like on mary janes. However, the inside and outside of the shoe had the same material which looked weird when it was all red, so I used probuilder to separate the inner and outer parts of the shoe. I created a tan material that I applied to the inside

At first, I had the spotlights attached to the wall facing the player, which resulted in slight backlighting of the objects. It didn't look great with the mannequin, but I made do
