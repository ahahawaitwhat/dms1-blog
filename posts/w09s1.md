Finding good assets for the objects in the maze were tricky, as not many of them would communicate what I wanted to effectively. For example, I found a "goth pleated skirt" which had a style I did like, but its uniqueness would distract from the idea I wanted to convey, which was simply a renewed interest in skirts. I eventually found a skirt with a plaid pattern that was too dark, so I changed up the material until I was happy with its contrast against the background. I also adjusted the mannequin underneath with probuilder so that it wouldn't clip through the skirt as they were two different assets.

Another tricky one was the makeup. I found a 3 models I could use, but the first one didn't have the materials that were shown on the sketchfab page. The mesh wasn't split either, so I couldn't change the material of the individual items unless I spent a long time selecting faces on probuilder as well as making each material from scratch. The second had some missing faces that couldn't be fixed by simply flipping the normals in probuilder, and the third had floating objects with meshes that weren't separated by each object but rather its materials. I settled on the third one and separated the objects using probuilder. I then downloaded a jewelry box asset and positioned everything in the box. 

I also tinkered with the mary jane heels - The model I downloaded was mostly black. I thought it didn't stand out enough from the black walls of the maze, so I changed the material to a bright red colour that I like on mary janes. However, the inside and outside of the shoe had the same material which looked weird when it was all red, so I used probuilder to separate the inner and outer parts of the shoe. I created a tan material that I applied to the inside

At first, I had the spotlights attached to the wall facing the player, which resulted in slight backlighting of the objects. It didn't look great with the mannequin, but I made do with it until I added the statue in at the end of the maze. Because of its height, the majority of it was unlit by the spotlight, so I changed the position of all the lights so that all the objects would be lit up properly. 

For the hallway, I already had a wooden sign with the words, "danger - do not enter - you will die" written on it that I was planning to put at the end, but since the hallway was now empty due to the fact that I put all the objects within the maze, I decided to put some more warning signs there to strengthen the forboding feeling of the drop off. The purpose of the feeling was to imitate the big mental leap I had to take to stop hiding my interests. It really did feel like I was dying (of shame and embarrassment) the first time I wore makeup in front of my friends, but in reality they didn't care beyond thinking it was cool that I had developed an interest in it. THe purpose of placing the objects within the black box rather than the outside world is to showcase that at first, I was secretive about these "feminine" things I liked before being more open about them. 

I also wanted the end of the hallway to be more of a square shape rather than a vertical rectangle, which was what it looked like initially. I used probuilder to drag the edges of the cubes that made up the hallway. This created some gaps and strange angles, which I fixed using more cubes. These cubes made the exterior of the hallway look messy, but that wasn't an issue as I was planning on using a trigger box to hide them. 

In total, I had 4 separate areas with trigger boxes/zones:

The first was above the glass; when the player stood on the glass, the mesh renderer of the carpet floor and roof of the first room would be disabled and an extra wall would be enabled, reducing distraction from the heart shape I was trying to create. 

The second was the entrance to the maze. While editing the terrain for the maze walls, I also made a hole the player would emerge from. This hole worked fine with the default terrain shader and any textures I added to it, but the shader didn't have a smoothness option. Without any smoothness, it would look significantly different from the rest of the material making up the black box, and there would be zero reflections meaning the maze would be much harder to navigate. When I created my own custom material for the maze, the hole wouldn't render properly (none of the terrain was visible from below which was ideal, but from above it appeared as if there was no hole) as I didn't have a custom terrain shader set up. I tried to look into how to do that, but the process was complicated and I couldn't find where the shader files were located despite researching for a while. I opted to use a trigger zone to cover up the hole instead as the player could pass through it despite there being no visible hole, and it looked quite different from the ground surrounding it. I had a cube with a hole in it to serve as the ground to the maze rather than the terrain, so I just duplicated that, rotated it so the hole would be somewhere else, and used the trigger zone to create a dynamic mesh renderer and box collider. 

The third was the hallway trigger zone as mentioned above. When the player was inside the black box/hallway and within viewing range of the hallway, everything inside would render. As soon as the player jumped off, the hallway renderers are disabled, and an extra wall to cover up the hole on the side of the black box would appear. I would like this to create a feeling of questioning whether everything inside the box was real or only existed in the metaphorical narrator's imagination. This reflects my experience of realising everything in my head was exaggerated and other people didn't actually care how feminine I was.

The fourth was a trigger to better optimise performance. I added this one at the end.
