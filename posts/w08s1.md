overall:
blocked out terrain, decided the pose - it was looking down rather than looking up because of the smile and i didn't know how to edit the mesh. added glasses. made the box by first creating a cube, sizing it right, then adding more cubes for the "walls" and deleting the original one

found terrain textures. decided the one outside would be more realistic (Polytope Studio), the one inside a "handpainted" feel. same for the sky. 
list adobe sources?
the environment model I found on sketchfab came with its own features and shaders which i used to the fullest extent. had all the trees and lods and shit set up.



first room:
Realised that the skirt would be visible through the floor of the box. wanted to use all the vertical space i had available so I made the terrain slanted. had the idea to put the slide there due to the slanted terrain to integrate the chidhood experience more

I don't have many screenshots of my early environment, but after laying out the basic positions of everything in the environment, I started designing the first area properly with assets. I found that I couldn't go for a detailed layout with just simple objects as I had a hard time picturing things.

In this screenshot you can see what the first area looked like midway through importing assets. I decided to arrange the objects in the shape of a heart when viewed from above to more emphatically communicate the rejection of emotion and things that are typically viewed as feminine. I textured the prototype boxes pink so that I could more easily see the heart shape when I viewed it from above.

added the room walls. With the sun, it didn't look like how it did in the sketchfab display, so I changed the materials to match it + fit my environment as much as I could. I added a ton of lights to everything but after a while they would just turn off so I reduced the amount of lights present. deleting and undoing would solve the issue temporarily, but they would always randomly turn off again at a certain point. I really tried to look into it, increased my max pixel light count etc but nothing helped. 

you could walk outside the slide so I put some planes on either side with box colliders. if the distance between the slide edge and the ground was small enough you could get on the slide, but you could never get off until you reached teh end.

I searched a long time for a good fence model. the best ones that resembled childrens playground equipment the most weren't downloadable. Midway through I also realised I needed a gate so I eventually decided on a picket fence model. I downloaded some textures and textured it myself. I settled on pink wood. Duplicated it - luckily the parts were all separate meshes so I could edit the fence how I saw fit.

I created an oblique path to walk backto the slide to immerse the player into the room more and show the different items. These items are either things I would've found pretty as a kid, or objects that are directly associated with my childhood. For instance, I've been playing piano since I was 3, so the toy piano is very closely associated with childhood. There is also an easel - I've always loved art. 

bouncy castle: I wanted a way to travel upwards to the next floor as you did have to go down the slide. First i wanted to put playground stairs in but I couldn't find any models that you could separate the stairs and railings from. I then had the idea to use a bouncy castle. looked through bouncy castle models and actually found a perfect free one. Ihad the idea to delete all the extra meshes I could and use other objects to cover the rest with because it really was the exact thing I had in mind. However, I saw that some faces were inverted and was extremely disappointed. this was when I looked into ways that you could directly edit the meshes. first I downloaded blender and it took me a while to even figure out how to navigate hte UI and delete the faces. I deleted all the faces I could and imported the model back in. However, in blender, the faces looked normal. There was an option to flip normals but I couldn't see any feedback. I tried to search how to After another google search for flipped normals I found some information on backface culling. I tried to find the settings for it but it wasn't working. I searched again for how to flip normals directly in unity and stumbled upon probuilder. I downloaded the package and started editing my meshes using probuilder until I was satisfied with the bouncy castle. In total, I used 2 extra duplicates of the original model: one to extend its length and one to create the landing at the top.
