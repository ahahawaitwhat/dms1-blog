I don't have many screenshots of my early environment, but after laying out the basic positions of everything in the environment, I started designing the first area properly with assets. I found that I couldn't go for a detailed layout with just simple objects as I had a hard time picturing things.

In this screenshot you can see what the first area looked like midway through importing assets. I decided to arrange the objects in the shape of a heart when viewed from apart to more emphatically communicate the rejection of emotion and things that are typically viewed as feminine. I textured the prototype boxes pink so that I could more easily see the heart shape when I viewed it from above.
