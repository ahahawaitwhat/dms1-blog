## Storyboard

![storyboard](/w02/storyboard.jpg)

This is a scene early on in the video where the bear interacts with music for the first time. The idea is that there is a cheesy pop instrumental playing in the background of a montage of mundane daily activities, and in the middle of doing homework, the bear can't stand the music anymore and turns it off. I'm trying to create a flow of walking left in this scene, so all of the bear's movements are towards the left until the end when the door closes to the right, indicating that they are walking back to their desk. I also plan to cut out some of the highs from the music up until they start walking closer to the source of the music to emphasise its diegesis in every montage shot, rather than just the last one. 

Use your own illustrations to indicate the composition and movement of shots and visual elements.

3. Upload your storyboard to your blog, along with a discussion of how you will establish and maintain continuity (and/or discontinuity) in your work.

4. Your blog post should also specifically discuss how your approach to editing will contribute to the main theme, concept, action, or emotion you hope to offer the viewer.
