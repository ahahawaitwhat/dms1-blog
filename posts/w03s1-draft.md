## Introduction

My video self portrait is a snapshot of my experience with music. Stitching together various moments of my journey, I hope to paint a humorous picture of my transition from hating most music, to finding something I liked, to suddenly discovering something that shook my world and still affects me in a visceral way.

## Draft process

The filming process was pretty challenging as I had to control the bear in often quite subtle and nuanced ways while trying to stay out of frame as much as possible. Every shot took at least several takes - the ones I filmed before I borrowed a tripod from the tech office were especially difficult. The shot that I'm the proudest of is the one at the very end where the bear is floating. I laid a navy blanket on my bed and turned on my lamp for some limited lighting, which illuminated the bear, but not the blanket. I then stood over the bed on a chair and slowly panned my camera to make it look like it was levitating. I had no idea if I could create this effect without filters up until I had it completely set up, so it was a relief when it worked out.

A few days before the lesson, I had a couple sequences filmed, with some of them missing 1 or 2 shots. At this point I wasn't sure which ones I'd use - I had the start and end of my video properly planned but I hadn't yet picked out the ideas in between that would convey what I wanted to best.

In order to get a clearer picture of the flow and timing, I edited the first scene together and it ended up a lot longer than I anticipated. I then tried to transfer the rest of my files to my laptop so I could see what I had to work with and get started on editing them too. However, the process was really slow and the upload kept failing, so I wasn't able to include them in my draft. Some clips did go through though, so I also put together the visuals for a later scene.
