## Scavenger Hunt

**🔲 An explosive cup of coffee.**

**☑️ A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many.**

We wandered around until we found the library. We then searched for the category that most likely had books on design. (I forgot what the category was called but I remember its corresponding number was 700.) We then wandered the library until we found the section we were looking for. It was difficult trying to pinpoint a book specifically on digital media but this was the one we thought most closely matched the description.

**☑️ A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo.**

While trying to find the exit to the library, we found a small balcony, where we could see the net. We took a photo on the balcony, but upon passing it later, we decided to take a closer photo.

**🔲 A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.**

**🔲 A door for the condemned.**

**☑️ A study space fit for a Sith Lord.**

As digital media students, we thought it was only fair we used every tool at our disposal, whether physical or digital. So we pulled up lost on campus. We located this area using the key words, "star wars".

**☑️ The disembodied hands of a great ape.**

Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to take a selfie with the hand as we found this while returning to the classroom, but I managed to snap a quick photo. Apologies for the incredibly low contrast in the photo - it's there if you squint. Hopefully this is the hand we were supposed to find and not just a coincidence that someone left a mannequin arm on the floor. We tried our best.

**☑️ A basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think.**

I think this was near the library - we found it by pure chance. It didn't quite fit the "basement-dwelling" descriptor but we thought it was close enough.

**☑️ A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.**

This was our first find after wandering around in buildings 8-10 for a little. It looked slightly wider than most Australian vending machines, and the drinks were mostly Japanese, which we thought was pretty far away.
