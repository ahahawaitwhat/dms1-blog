## Thumnail sketch class task

![thumbnail sketch exercise](/w04/hat.png)

I think hat no. 4 (row 1 column 4) is the most effective. It is in the centre of the frame, while being tilted at a slight angle. This way, it keeps the visual balance while also appearing more dynamic than some of the other rigid, symmetrical designs. A floppy sunflower hat is also a very recognisable hat compared to some of the others.

Initially, I drew the graphics as they appeared in my head - I was imagining warning signs that appear in day to day life like "slippery when wet" or "no running at the pool". In my head there was a clear image of the iconic stick figure being subjected to my 9 methods of torture. However, halfway through, I realised some of them had too many elements, or would've been hard to recognise and distinguish from each other. So I started simplifying my designs. I'm still not happy with a lot of these but I will probably iterate them during my process on illustrator. 

I like the design in the first box for the flamethrower. The horizontal composition (as opposed to the diagonal ones of the others) gives more of a sense of stability. The flames also spread and come back together at the right edge of the image, giving a nice sense of balance and helping the icon feel rounded out.
