## Sound design

A key moment in my self portrait would be the final scene, where the bear discovers Radiohead/electronica through a reddit post. I want to convey a nonchalant feeling at the start, transitioning into an sudden surge of ethereality and bliss.

In the previous scene, the bear discovers jazz, which is followed by an upbeat rhythmic montage of listening to it on their own in a couple of different locations. This scene starts as a part of the montage, with the cuts of the different camera angles also following the rhythm of the music, keeping the audience's attention on the music and its diegesis. When the mouse clicks the link, both the music and visuals quickly fade to a couple seconds of black. This will really show a disruption in the bear's life and create a tension that will be released in the next part.

After the black screen, both the visuals (extreme close up reaction shot zooming in) and the ambient track will gradually fade in, contrasting with the way the jazz was suddenly cut off and the rhythmic editing. I aim to portray the ethereal feeling with these slow movements. The music here will also be noticeably louder than the jazz, showing that this musical experience is all encompassing.

I like the idea of creating humour through reaction shots of a subject that can't change their facial expression. I aim to use the zooming close up to slightly poke fun at the bear's extreme reaction to the music.
