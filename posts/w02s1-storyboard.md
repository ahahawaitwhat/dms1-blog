## Storyboard

![storyboard](/w02/storyboard.jpg)

This storyboard depicts a scene early in the video where the bear interacts with music for the first time. Following a montage of mundane daily activities with a cheesy pop song playing on top, the bear is doing homework and finally can't stand the music anymore, walking over to their sister's room and pressing pause on spotify.

I'm trying to create a flow of walking left in this scene, so all of the bear's movements are towards the left until the end when the door closes to the right, indicating that they are walking back to their desk. I also plan to cut out some of the highs from the music up until they start walking closer to the source of the music to emphasise its diegesis in every montage shot, rather than just this one. A broader concern with continuity would be controlling the bear during the filming process. It would be unrealistic to aim for a total absence of my hands in the frame, so I might just try to avoid drawing too much attention to them. However, I won't try to hide the fact that they're there, as I think the inclusion of my hands adds an nice subtext, emphasising the aura of immaturity as well as highlighting the bear as a tool to somewhat dissociate myself from the emotions in the video.

This one was for an earlier iteration of my concept, which delved more into my mental state while listening to music. It got too convoluted so I scrapped it.
