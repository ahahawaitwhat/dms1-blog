## Storyboard

![storyboard](/w02/storyboard.jpg)

This storyboard depicts a scene early in the video where the bear interacts with music for the first time. Following a montage of mundane daily activities with a cheesy pop song playing on top, the bear is doing homework and finally can't stand the music anymore. They walk over to their sister's room and press pause on Spotify.

I'm trying to create a flow of walking left in this scene, so all of the bear's movements are towards the left until the end when the door closes to the right, indicating that they are walking back to their desk. I also plan to use a subtle low-pass filter up until they get closer to the source of the music to emphasise its diegesis in every montage shot, rather than just this one. 

A broader concern with continuity would be controlling the bear during the filming process. It would be unrealistic to aim for a total absence of my hands in the frame, so I might just try to avoid drawing too much attention to them. I won't hide the fact that they're there as I think the inclusion of my hands adds an nice subtext, simultaneously forming a stronger link between me and the bear, as well as highlighting it to the audience as a tool to somewhat dissociate myself from being the subject of the video, allowing the emotions to be more honestly portrayed. The bear being actively controlled by something external also amplifies the aura of naivety that is already coming from the bear itself. This feeling of naivety and slight inferiority is something that I generally experience day to day, so I want it to come through in my video.

This one was for an earlier iteration of my concept, which delved more into my mental state while listening to music. It got too convoluted so I scrapped it.
