## Black squares activity

Tools I used:
- Zoomed in using the zoom tool - I tried to use a keyboard shortcut but it didn't work. I clicked on the canvas to zoom in, and alt clicked to zoom out.
- Shift clicked to select multiple elements at once.
- Resized these elements by dragging the corners of the box, and held shift to keep the aspect ratio of the square.
 
I tried my best to keep balance within my designs, at times through symmetry and other times through more organic asymmetry with similar visual weight on different sides. On the "bold" and "congested" designs, I reduced the amount of negative space in order to communicate the concepts better.
The "congested" concept was the hardest one to come up with ideas for. There were only so many ways I rotate the large squares without having them appear as one shape. The one I picked in the end did do that a little but it was also the most visually balanced and appealing to look at.


## Platform, context, and audience

I settled on the prompt, "Home", for my assignment. My idea is to design icons for a future technologically advanced setting where people can brutally dispose of intruders who step foot in their homes. For the platform, I'm imagining a physical object with buttons that have the icons, like a microwave. They could belong on a desk or a wall, and would be arranged in a standard 3x3 grid. My audience would be extremely rich and bored homeowners who lack empathy. The decisions on how the intruders would go would be treated with whimsy and amusement, and I want my icons to reflect that.
