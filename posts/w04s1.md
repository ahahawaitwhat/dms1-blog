zoom in using the zoom tool. tried to use keyboard shortcut but didn't work. click for zoom in, alt click for zoom out. also shift clicked to select multiple elements at once. resized by dragging the corners of the box, and held shift to keep the aspect ratio of the square. 
I tried my best to keep balance within my designs, at times through symmetry and other times through more organic asymmetry with similar visual weight on different sides. On the "bold" and "congested" designs, I reduced the amount of negative space in order to communicate the concepts better.
The "congested" concept was the hardest one to come up with ideas for. there were only so many ways I rotate the large squares without having htem appear as one shape. The one i picked in the end did do that a bit but it was also the most visually balanced and appealing to look at. i still think it conveys 

3. Document this process in a blog post, including at least some discussion on how you explicitly applied skills learned in the video tutorials, and how you applied elements of design thinking to the task.

4. Identify which prompt or prompts from the Assignment 2 brief appeal to you the most. 

5. Using a mindmapLinks to an external site. or other brainstorming method, generate as many terms and concepts as you can that relate to that prompt.

6. As part of this process, write a blog post in which you outline a specific platform (i.e: iPhone, Google Chrome, Playstation), context (i.e: items on a printed menu, navigational elements on a website, a videogame UI), and audience (i.e: age, interests, background) for your icon designs.

Platform: either a futuristic smart device or some hardware buttons
Audience: very rich people in the future who are completely detached from reality and other humans.
