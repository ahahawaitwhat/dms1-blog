## Process

I went through a couple iterations for my icons. First, I directly sketched the ideas in my thumbnail sketches onto the illustrator file with the pencil tool.

For my final icons, I decided to confine the lines to a grid of 12x12, trying my best to also follow a 3x3 grid more strongly than the other points in the grid.
